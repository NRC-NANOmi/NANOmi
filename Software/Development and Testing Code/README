PRESET:
-How to save all pyqt window settings. Could be a useful if program crashes since everything will be saved.
-source:https://gist.github.com/eyllanesc/be8a476bb7038c7579c58609d7d0f031

-How to implement with accessing variables in both files.
Ex Import file1 inside file2:
-To import all variables from file1 without flooding file2's namespace, use:
"import file1" inside file2
-now use file1.x1, file1.x2, ... to access the variables of file1 in file 2
- This method allows you change the data in file 1 by changing data in file 2 which would be useful for loading
-x1 and x2 etc should be lists or dictionaries since those are mutable variables in python

What I planned on doing with saving.
-with the above implementation to access vairables and in the preset file importing from all other addonmodules
-the save button should loop through all the lists/dictionaries in each of file in addonmodules and write the data into save the file made

What I planned on doing with loading.
-with the above implementation to access vairables and in the preset file importing from all other addonmodules
-when the load button is pressed read the file selected, use REGEX to find specific data.
-assign each data piece and loading will be done automaticaly

Current issues in PRESET
-accessing variables works but changing them from the file that imported doesn't work unless same folder as NANOmi.py. 
-addonmodules files starting with numbers cause importing issues when trying to access variables in another file
