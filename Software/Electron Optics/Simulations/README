Simulations that were used for electron optics design can be found here. 

tilt.py is a script used to find the combination of deflector voltages
in order to achieve a certain electron beam tilt angle. It also plots the trajectory 
of the electron. 

shift.py is used to plot and calculate the shift of electrons
between different deflector voltages. It is similar to tilt.py.

Deflectortracing.py is used to import electrostatic field data (from FEA simulations such as Comsol, etc)
and then plot the trajectory of electrons within the field.
